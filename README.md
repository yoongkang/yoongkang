### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer in Australia.

If you look at my projects you'll find a lot of them are in Python, but I really consider myself technology-agnostic. I enjoy both frontend and backend work.

Here's how to reach me:

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoong-kang-lim/)
- [Personal website](https://yoongkang.com)

I'm currently gainfully employed, but am always open to the right opportunity. Please contact me via one of the methods above.
